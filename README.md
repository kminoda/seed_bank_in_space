# seed_bank_in_space
Seed bank in space is a brand new spacecraft which aims to preserve seeds in space for a long term (~100 years).  
This is a repository to stock a calculation for concept design of our spacecraft. This includes  
- thermal design
- electricity design
- reentry design (analysis of supersonic speed dynamics)
- propulsion estimation
- evaluation of cosmic ray protection for preserving seeds
- structure design
- etc
